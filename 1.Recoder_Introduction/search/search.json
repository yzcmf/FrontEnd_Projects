You can reduce static electricity by wearing non-synthetic clothes that prevent the emergence of static electricity. ¶      ¶    ¶    ¶      On noise ¶      ¶        Noise may be heard when the unit is placed near an AC power source, a fluorescent lamp or a mobile phone during recording or playback.¶        Noise may be recorded when an object, such as your finger, etc., rubs or scratches the unit during recording. ¶      ¶    ¶    ¶      On maintenance¶       To clean the exterior, use a soft cloth slightly moistened in water. Then use a soft dry cloth to wipe the exterior. Do not use alcohol, benzine or thinner.¶      If you have any questions or problems concerning your unit, please consult your nearest Sony dealer. ¶    ¶    ¶      Backup recommendations ¶      To avoid potential risk of data loss caused by accidental operation or malfunction of the IC recorder, we recommend that you save a backup copy of your recorded files to a computer, etc.¶    ¶    ¶      On using a memory card¶      ¶         When formatting (initializing) a memory¶          card, make sure to use the IC recorder to¶          format it.

,{toc_id:"../contents/TP0000016892",body:"¶Listening for a Lifetime¶¶ Important information on the sound level. ¶ Selecting fine audio equipment such as the unit you've just purchased is only the start of your musical enjoyment. Now it's time to consider how you can maximize the fun and excitement your equipment offers. This manufacturer, the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) ® and the American Speech- Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) want you to get the most out of your equipment by playing it at a safe level; a level that lets the sound come through clearly without annoying blaring or distortion and, most importantly, without damaging your sensitive hearing. ¶Sound can be deceiving. Over time your hearing “comfort level” adapts to higher volumes of sound. So what sounds “normal” can actually be loud and harmful to your hearing. Guard against this by setting your equipment at a safe level BEFORE your hearing adapts. ¶¶¶  ¶    ¶      TO ESTABLISH A SAFE LEVEL¶      ¶        Set your volume control to the lowest level where you can hear the music comfortably and clearly. Prolonged exposure to anything over 85 decibels can cause gradual hearing loss. ¶        Once you have established a sound level where you can hear the audio comfortably, clearly and without distortion, set the dial and leave it there. ¶        See if your music player has a volume limiter that allows you to set a safe listening level by establishing a maximum volume level on your player. This is a great solution for parents to ensure their children listen at a safe level. ¶        Limit listening time to give your hearing “quiet breaks.” ¶      ¶    ¶    ¶      BE SURE TO OBSERVE THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES WHEN WEARING YOUR HEADPHONES OR EARBUDS¶      ¶        Do not turn up the volume so high that you can't hear sounds around you.¶        Do not use headphones or earbuds while operating a motorized vehicle; it may create a traffic hazard and is illegal in many areas.¶      ¶       Used wisely, your new sound equipment will provide years of fun and enjoyment. Since hearing damage from loud noise is often undetectable until it is too late, this manufacturer, CEA and ASHA recommend that you avoid prolonged exposure to excessive noise. The following list of sound levels is included for your information so that you can better protect your hearing. ¶    ¶    ¶      DECIBEL LEVEL EXAMPLES:¶      30 Whisper¶      40 Quiet room¶      50 Moderate rainfall¶      60 Normal conversation¶      70 Busy traffic, vacuum cleaner¶      80 Alarm clock¶    ¶    ¶      CONSTANT EXPOSURE TO THESE NOISES CAN BE DANGEROUS:¶      90 Lawn mower, motorcycle¶      100 Chain saw¶      110 Rock concert¶      120 Jet plane takeoff¶      130 Jackhammer¶      140 Firecrackers¶      This information courtesy of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA), the national professional, scientific and credentialing association for more than 135,000 audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and speech, language and hearing scientists.
